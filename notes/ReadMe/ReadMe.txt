If you used this script congrats! you're only half way there. 
		
		this script is not perfect by any standards and WILL net you errors and such. it's up to you now to fix the rest, and i can recommend you to use Dogscepter (if you even know what that is) to finish it off and do the rest manually.

		Happy Decompiling! -Melia

Another note, this game IS made in GM2.3+ so some of the code probably failed to decompile.
 Dogscepter helps amazingly here
